I'm Revanth Harinarthini, a 24-year-old pursuing my master's degree in Computer Science at ASU. I have a keen interest in image processing and backend development, and I'm always looking for new challenges to tackle.

In terms of my professional experience, I've worked as a research intern at DRDO, where I worked on facial image recognition and identity analysis. I've also interned at Bluejeans by Verizon and JPMC, which gave me an opportunity to work on both frontend and backend technologies.

I'm proud to say that I have a diverse set of skills, including Java, JavaScript, C#, Python, C/C++, HTML, CSS, Angular, Backbone, Flask, Node.JS, Express.JS, MySQL, Perforce, Git, AWS services, Docker, .NET Framework, .NET Core, Angular, Django Framework, Handlebars.js, and even neural networks and MongoDB.

When I'm not coding, I enjoy exploring the world of literature and finding poetic meanings in Indian song lyrics. I'm also a big movie buff and can talk about films for hours on end.

Looking to the future, my career goal is to become a software architect in healthcare. I want to use my skills to make a real difference in the world and work towards the welfare of society. With my technical expertise and creative thinking, I'm confident that I can achieve that goal and more.

Write your biography here. Tell the world about yourself. Link to your favorite [subreddit](http://reddit.com). You can put a picture in, too. The code is already in, just name your picture `prof_pic.jpg` and put it in the `img/` folder.

Put your address / P.O. box / other info right below your picture. You can also disable any of these elements by editing `profile` property of the YAML header of your `_pages/about.md`. Edit `_bibliography/papers.bib` and Jekyll will render your [publications page](/al-folio/publications/) automatically.

Link to your social media connections, too. This theme is set up to use [Font Awesome icons](http://fortawesome.github.io/Font-Awesome/) and [Academicons](https://jpswalsh.github.io/academicons/), like the ones below.
